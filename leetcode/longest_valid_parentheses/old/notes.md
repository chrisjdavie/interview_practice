* the stack approach was *obviously* not the simplest approach, I didn't even consider brute force
* brute force might have led me to think about the DP approach
* I would never have figured out the simplified stack approach
* I need to think about the count approach - I was nearly there

I do wonder if this is a class of problem I'm not super familiar with, as I wouldn't have figured out the optimal solutions myself at all.
