4. How to find the memory size of any array
- didn't know np internal
5. How to get the documentation of the numpy add function from the command line?
- forgot python -c, didn't know np internal
7. Create a vector with values ranging from 10 to 49 
- did it the Python way, not the np way
9. Create a 3x3 matrix with values ranging from 0 to 8
- there was a more elegant way than I did it
10. Find indices of non-zero elements from [1,2,0,0,4,0]
- was a more simple way
11. Create a 3x3 identity matrix
- forgot the command for the identity matrix
12. Create a 3x3x3 array with random values
- did it the complicated way
13. Create a 10x10 array with random values and find the minimum and maximum values 
- tried to do it with native Python
14. Create a random vector of size 30 and find the mean value
- over complicated it
15. Create a 2d array with 1 on the border and 0 inside
Got 2D array indexing wrong, over complicated it
16. How to add a border (filled with 0's) around an existing array?
Didn't know numpy did this
17. What is the result of the following expression? 
Forgot about code weirdness with certain numbers
18. Create a 5x5 matrix with values 1,2,3,4 just below the diagonal
Did this the hard way
